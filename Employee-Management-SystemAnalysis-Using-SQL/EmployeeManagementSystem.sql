-- In SQL, the EXPLAIN keyword provides a description of how the SQL queries are executed by the databases. These descriptions include the optimizer logs, how tables are joined and in what order, etc.
-- Hence, it would be a useful tool in query optimization and knowing the details of its execution step by step. The EXPLAIN also indicates the fact that a user who doesnâ€™t
-- have any access to a particular database will not be provided details about how it executes the queries. So it maintains security as well.
